    thx to ayoung for sorting this out.

    re: http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/studygroups/com17/languages/X.690-0207.pdf

    pg4:  For tags from 0 to 30 the first octet is the identfier
    pg10: Hex 30 means sequence, followed by the length of that sequence.
    pg5:  Second octet is the length octet
          first bit indicates short or long form, next 7 bits encode the number
          of subsequent octets that make up the content length octets as an
          unsigned binary int

          82 = 10000010 (first bit indicates long form)
          0000010 = 2 octets of content length
          so read the next 2 octets to get the length of the content.

    In the case of a very large content length there could be a requirement to
    have more than 2 octets to designate the content length, therefore
    requiring us to check for MIM, MIQ, etc.
    In [4]: base64.b64encode(binascii.a2b_hex('3083'))
    Out[4]: 'MIM='
    In [5]: base64.b64encode(binascii.a2b_hex('3084'))
    Out[5]: 'MIQ='
    Checking for MI would become invalid at 16 octets of content length
    10010000 = 90
    In [6]: base64.b64encode(binascii.a2b_hex('3090'))
    Out[6]: 'MJA='
    Checking for just M is insufficient

    But we will only check for MII:
    Max length of the content using 2 octets is 7FFF or 32767
    It's not practical to support a token of this length or greater in http
    therefore, we will check for MII only and ignore the case of larger tokens
